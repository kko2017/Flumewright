Flumewright is a high-throughput message bus where a standalone **Broker** process mediates
communication between **Publisher** and **Subscriber** processes over gRPC, following the
publish-subscribe pattern. It is built on a **Kafka-style log model**: publish appends to a
per-partition append-only log, and subscribers consume by pulling at their own offset.

> **Status:** Phase 1 in progress. M1 (gRPC contract + broker host + pub→sub) and M2
> (partitioning + append-only log + offset-based consumption) are complete. Transport security
> (mTLS), consumer groups, offset-commit acks, and 100K-scale streaming are upcoming milestones —
> see [Roadmap](#%EF%B8%8F-roadmap). Features below are marked ✅ done or 🔜 planned accordingly.

## 🤖 Built with AI — under human control

Flumewright was built using an **agent-assisted workflow** (Claude for planning, design, and code
review; Gemini CLI for implementation), with the human owning all architecture, verification, and
decisions. Work was delegated in small, scoped, individually-verified steps; every design choice and
fix is recorded; total tooling cost was kept **under $60/month**.

This is *assisted*, not autonomous: the AI never pushes to remote, never decides scope, and every
proposal is approved or rejected by a human. Hand code-review caught real defects the AI had reported
as passing tests (see the decision-and-fix log).

See **[AI Collaboration & Cost Strategy](docs/ai-collaboration.md)** for the full model — control
mechanisms, verification discipline, and cost strategy.

## ✨ Features

**Working today (M1–M2):**
- ✅ **Process isolation** — the broker runs as an independent process; clients connect over gRPC
- ✅ **Log-based delivery** — publish appends to a per-partition append-only log; messages are retained
  (for the process lifetime in Phase 1) rather than pushed-and-forgotten
- ✅ **Partitioning & routing** — a topic is split into N partitions; a `partition_key` routes by stable
  hash (same key → same partition → per-partition ordering), and keyless messages spread round-robin
- ✅ **Offset-based consumption** — subscribers pull by holding their own offset (cursor); fan-out is many
  subscribers reading the same log at their own offsets
- ✅ **Extensibility** — the broker treats payloads as opaque bytes, so clients may use any `.proto` they like

**Planned (later milestones):**
- 🔜 **At-least-once delivery via offset commit** — durable consumer progress + redelivery (M3)
- 🔜 **Consumer groups** — partition assignment across group members for load balancing (M3)
- 🔜 **mTLS security** — mutual certificate verification (M4)
- 🔜 **100K-scale throughput** — streaming publish + batching + backpressure (M5)
- 🔜 **Observability** — metrics and structured logging (M6; distributed tracing in Phase 2)
- 🔜 **Persistence & retention** — disk-backed log, eviction policy, replay/seek (Phase 2)

 Publish appends to a partition's log; each subscriber reads the log at its own offset.
 (mTLS, consumer groups, offset-commit acks, and streaming publish are upcoming — see Roadmap.)

See [docs/design/plan.md](docs/design/plan.md) for the full design.

### Concurrency

A message bus lives or dies on concurrency correctness — many publishers append at once, many
subscribers read at once, and each partition is served by its own background reader. A single race,
lost wakeup, or swallowed exception can silently drop a message or hang a subscriber. Flumewright
defends concurrency in **depth — five independent layers**: disciplined code patterns, human +
isolated-AI review, static analysis (Roslyn `CA1031` / SonarCloud / CodeQL), concurrency tests, and
systematic schedule exploration (Microsoft Coyote, planned). Two real bugs have already been caught
by *different* layers (FIX-009 by human review, FIX-010 by static analysis).

Full strategy → **[Concurrency Strategy](docs/design/concurrency-strategy.md)**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (8.0.x)
- Git

### Build & Test
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kko2017/Flumewright.git
cd Flumewright

dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Unit + integration tests (excludes load tests)
dotnet test --filter "Category!=Load"
```

### Run the Broker
```bash
dotnet run --project src/Flumewright.Broker
```
The broker starts a gRPC host (plaintext in Phase 1; mTLS arrives in M4). Publishers append to a
topic's partition log; subscribers stream messages from their offset.

### Run the Sample Publisher / Subscriber
```bash
# Terminal 1 — subscriber
dotnet run --project samples/SampleSubscriber

# Terminal 2 — publisher
dotnet run --project samples/SamplePublisher
```
The samples use the `Flumewright.Client` SDK (`FlumewrightPublisher` / `FlumewrightSubscriber`).
See the integration tests for further end-to-end usage.

## 🔄 Development Workflow

- **Branches**: `main` (always green) + milestone branches (`feat/mN-...`)
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:` ...)
- **Validation**: pre-commit hook (build + unit tests) → CI (unit + integration) → merge to main
- **Releases**: push a `vX.Y.Z` tag → automated Release publishing

See [docs/guides/version-control-and-validation-guide.md](docs/guides/version-control-and-validation-guide.md) for the full rules.

### Workflows (GitHub Actions)
| Workflow | Trigger | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| CI | push/PR → main | Build + unit/integration tests + dev artifact |
| Load Tests | manual / nightly | Performance & stress tests |
| Release | push `v*` tag | Release build + publish to Releases tab |
